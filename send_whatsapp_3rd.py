Iâ€™m reaching out on behalf of Chitti, GITAMâ€™s fastest-growing exam prep startup ðŸš€

In our last two launches, 8,000+ students used Chitti for their exam prep. In our most recent monetized launch, we even generated over â‚¹40,000 in revenue, proving the demand for high-quality content from toppers.
Now, weâ€™re scaling this up for the upcoming August 28th Mid Exams, and weâ€™re onboarding a few standout 3rd semester students as Subject Experts.
Based on your 1st year performance, we believe you'd be a perfect fit. This is a paid opportunity + a chance to be a core part of something big at GITAM! ðŸŒŸ
Let me know if youâ€™re interested â€” would love to share more details!

â€“ Team Chitti
